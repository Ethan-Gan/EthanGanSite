## Entering the Azure Atmosphere.

During my previous role as a Waterloo Experience Accelerate program Project Team Member, I worked with a remote team of five, to conceptualize an AI solution for preventing financial fraud against seniors culminating in a 15 minute pitch. 

## Our Fraud Prevention Solution

We planned a anomaly detection machine learning strategy and chatbot app for guided advice and recommendations on how the fraud was detected and how to prevent it. I was the group's UX designer and was responsible for the solution description and developed the user flow and wireframe diagram to visualize our app. 


Here is a pipeline of the features, outlined in our project.

## Feature Rich Accessibility

The important aspect to consider when designing for seniors is familiarity and ease of use. A complicated design with many hidden elements may confuse users who are expecting obvious buttons to traverse their screen.

I applied this methodology to design the chatbot to be as accessible and familiar to our target audience of seniors as possible. I used familiar colours of 80s websites with high contrast black and white buttons along with accessibility features such as click to command, and text-to-speech.

Part of limiting frustration and the barrier to learning is knowing where to start, to crack the ice, we made designed premade AI-powered prompts on each page to help guide the user without the need of a keyboard.

## Project Results 
 As a result, we were commended by our program group lead and were asked if they could use our recorded presentation as a reference for future students and mentors. Our presentation received the highest possible score and I and another group member received the best scores for participation and communication.
