# Making Competitive Coding Fun and Quirky!

As a Thornhill Secondary School Computer Club executive and competitive divison member for 4 years, I quickly grew to understand there were two different types of club meetings. Ones where the room was ful of people bouncing ideas off each other with friendly banter and lessons where people would nod and then get started on homework assigned through the day.

It was always funny problem descriptions or memes that caused heads to perk up to listen.
My goal was to grab people in with weird stories and hook them with an overarching plot. 

A problem I am particularly fond of is a BFS problem with the goal of finding coals in Santa's mine on behalf of elves banished to Sata's infamous "Jolly" coal mines due to the absurdity of the problem description and fun implementation of a basic search concept. <br>

Another problem I developed showcases the application of contest programming and string algorithms on DNA sequencing through breaking an mRNA strand into groups of triplet base pairs. My goal was to demonstrate the transferrable skills gained in the process of learning to code. <br>

Here is an example of one of the contests I organized: <br>

# On the Skilled End

I learned and applied <strong>test case design</strong> first hand and using <strong>input and output test suites</strong> to judge the varying levels of correctness of submissions. This involved speed, memory, and edgecases. It also finding creative ways to generate input and outputs quickly as problems became double-sided in creating large amounts of high quality test cases and also creating solutions.
<br>

For example, for the Jolly Mines problem I had to work backwards and generate rectangle rooms of varying dimensions and layouts.
